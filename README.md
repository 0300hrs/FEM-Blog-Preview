Guidelines for Video Siri (Complex Queries) Training
10/28/24 - New section 3.4.21 Brand Results, updates to sections 1.3 Reasoning (Comments), 3.5 Problem: Other, 3.4.2 'Free' Queries
10/10/24 - updated tables under 3.4.18 Person and 3.4.15 Time Period Queries sections.
1. Introduction 
In this document, we explain relevance rating guidelines for video search on Apple TV. If you are not familiar with the Apple TV app, please refer to https://www.apple.com/apple-tva-app/ for an overview and basic information about this app.
Please use the sidebar to help you navigate through your reading.
1.1 The importance of your work as a Rater
Each of the judgements you complete will be used to build and improve artificial intelligence systems such as search algorithms and machine learned rankers that power the user experience for Apple TV users. Your attention to detail, research and language skills as well as your cultural knowledge of the market are all critical to the success of our projects.

Your judgements should represent those of an Apple TV user who is using the Search feature. Ask yourself if you would be content with the results returned for a particular search query. Is there a significant relationship between the query and content returned? Would you be content if you see this content appear as a search result? Stay curious and complete thorough research.

Our ultimate goal is to surprise and delight our customers by improving search quality and enhancing customer satisfaction, and you play an important role in this.

Please keep in mind that your tasks will be spot-checked for quality, and measured against those of your peers.


1.2 Primary and Secondary Intent 
The primary intent of a query is the most likely intent, i.e. the intent of most users who say the given query. Some queries may have multiple primary intents.

A secondary intent is less likely, or would be a less popular intent compared to a primary one. A secondary intent could include:
Content relevant to a smaller group of users than for the primary intent. For queries like [shows] and [movies], the primary intent is usually media content for adults. Content for children would be considered secondary intent, except Shen the intent is obviously kids-related (such as cartoons, animated films, etc.).
Complimentary content such as trailers, reviews, cast members, or interviews with the cast on how the movie was made. 
Lower quality/lesser-known content that is relevant to the query but is not the primary intent, a content that is dated or less popular.

1.2 Query Types & Intents
This evaluation contains long, complex queries that may contain multiple aspects, such as specifying a genre, time-period and actor all in one query. These queries will broadly fall into three different categories that will be rated differently.

1.2.1 Browse 
The first type is queries with a browsing intent. These queries will point to a larger set of content where the user doesn’t have anything specific in mind. Some examples:
[best tv shows set in the future] 
[i want a a classic made for tv type move]
[show me commedies available in french]
[whats something good to watch around chinese new years]

1.2.2 Navigational (Video Navigational & Single Results Navigational)
The second type of queries have a video navigational intent. These queries are looking for a specific piece of content or a small list of contents. Navigational queries are categorized as either Video Navigational or Single Navigational. The key difference is that Single Results Navigational queries refer to a specific movie, whereas Video Navigational queries may target a broader range of content.

Examples:

Video Navigational:
[james bond movies with pierce brosnan] → Pierce Brosnan was James Bond in 4 films
[all kardashians shows] → Looking for shows related to the Kardashian family, like The Kardashians and Keeping Up with the Kardashians
Single Results Navigational:
[James bond movie quantum something] → Looking for Quantum of Solace
[most recent best picture academy awards] → Looking for a specific movie
[that tv+ show where the actor travels the world even though he hates travel] → This describes The Reluctant Traveler with Eugene Levy

1.2.3 Similarity 
The final type of query is when the user is looking for content similar to another piece of content. These queries will generally reference a piece(s) of content and use phrases like “similar to” or “like”. 

Examples:
[movies like top gun]
[suspensful show similar to the 100]
[show me something super dark like sey7en]

1.3 Reasoning (Comments)
For these complex queries it is especially important to provide the reasoning for a result being relevant to the query. Thus, for each result you must provide the following in the Comments field. Although the Comments field is labeled as "optional," it is mandatory, and you are required to provide your reasoning.
Provide a concise explanation indicating why it should be considered relevant, not relevant, or the relevance considered as ambiguous via unknown. Your explanation MUST answer each of the following questions:
What is the intent of the query?
Are there any abbreviations? If so, explain them (e.g. "90s refers to the time between 1990 and 1999").
How is the result relevant to the query?
The reasoning field should be primarily focused on the connection of the result to the query rather than explaining the specific rating given.

Examples:
Below are examples of the reasoning for different query and result pairs. The examples are color coded to show how the questions are answered.

.
2. Rating Process
2.1 Query Research
To complete query research, tap into your local market knowledge in addition to online sources such as IMDB, YouTube, Wikipedia, video streaming services, local content evaluators and social media. Consider how a user of Apple TV engages the search feature to navigate to a specific set of content, or as a means to browse a larger catalogue of titles.

Online Research 
IMDB
Popularity Ranking
Rating Counts
Storyline, Taglines
Genre
Release Date
For topic, decade, etc: (IMDB Sort By feature)
Box Office Mojo
Local Box Office Rankings
Common Sense Media
Age Rating → for determination of kids content
Wikipedia
Information of the movie/show: plot, cast, awards, nominations, crew
Social Media 
Trending films
Followers on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc. can help to determine a person’s popularity 
YouTube trailer views 
Make sure to factor in time, consider the monthly average views since its upload
Local content evaluators
To identify popularity in the market

2.2 Aspects to Consider
For Browse and Navigational queries, consider aspects: 
Relevance(2.2.1)
Popularity(2.2.2)
Recency(2.2.3)
For Similarity queries, focus on aspects: 
Target Aspects(2.2.4)
Factual Aspects(2.2.5)
Theme(2.2.6)
Definitions are below.

2.2.1 Relevance
Relevance is in short, the connection of query to the output. Below are examples where the show Ted Lasso might surface. 

.
What if the query is only partially relevant?

Results may match part of a query. In these cases, we weigh query requirements in its importance as a requirement and on a scale from Factual to Ambiguous. For fully Factual aspects, anything that doesn’t match would be considered Off-Topic. For more Ambiguous requirements, we would demote the rating by 1 (e.g., Good → Acceptable) if the result matches other aspects but not that requirement.\

Example: [exciting 2000’s documentary with morgan freeman]
exciting is a subjective mood that is hard to define. If the result is a 2000’s documentary with Morgan Freeman that you don’t consider exciting, it still relevant and fulfills the intent as we cannot really define what an “exciting documentary” is.
note: if the query is [exciting dramas with Morgan Freeman], it's more reasonable to evaluate the plot to determine if the movie appears exciting. If the result is a "boring" drama with Morgan Freeman, it would merit a rating demotion of 1.
2000’s is factual, therefore the content needs to be from the years 2000 to 2009 or explicitly about that time period to be considered fully relevant. Content from before 2000 is off-topic, and content from 2010 onwards still holds some relevance but receives 1 rating demotion.
documentary is also factual, but not a hard requirement. An exciting 2000s movie with Morgan Freeman that is based on a true story (not a documentary), could be partially relevant and receive a 1 rating demotion.
morgan freeman is a fully factual requirement. Any content without Morgan Freeman would be considered off-topic. 

Note: The above guidance is primarily for Browse queries. For Navigational queries, consider the above if the result is a secondary intent.

2.2.2 Popularity
Remember that popularity is a sliding scale that depends on the relevance of the content for a given query. For example, a query like [action comedies that don’t have sci-fi elements] has a much larger pool of relevant content compared to [Norwegian comedy shows about school children]. Consequently, a Norwegian action comedy show might be considered very popular in the context of the second query but not as popular in the context of the first, due to the differing sets of relevant results.

2.2.3 Recency
In general, users are more satisfied with newer content, so our ratings should prioritize content that has not been out as long. Similar to popularity, recency exists on a sliding scale. Broad queries such as [what's something I can watch with surround sound] would have more relevant results compared to query [historical dramas where they speak latin]. Therefore, the recency of a result should be evaluated in relation to the other possible results that can be returned for the query.

For TV shows, recency is determined by the release date of the most recent season.

2.2.2 Target Audience
The target audience for a movie includes considerations of two factors: Genre and Age Rating (Kids (PG) vs Everyone (PG-13, TV-14) vs Adults (R)). If a content fits within these age ratings and its genre aligns with the interests of that audience, it is generally considered to target that specific group.

2.2.3 Factual Aspects
Factual aspects is determined by two aspects:
Cast & Crew: Actors, Producers, Studio, etc.
Setting: Location AND Time Period in which the content plays

2.2.4 Theme
Theme refers to what is the content is about - the underlying message, idea, or lesson that a movie conveys beyond its plot and characters.

3. Rating Scale & Examples
Each of our three query types have different ways of applying the principles outline above. Reference the section below to see a deeper dive and examples on how to rate each type of query.
3.1 Browse
For browse queries there is no “Perfect” results. This is because, by their nature, the user is not looking for anything specific and is instead browsing. Therefore, the highest rating available is “Excellent”, and ratings are determined based on relevance, popularity, and recency.

General Guideline:
Excellent → The returned content is relevant to the query (not only by title), popular and recent.
Good → The returned content is relevant to the query, and either popular or recent. 
Acceptable → The returned content is relevant to the query and neither popular nor recent.
Off-Topic → Regardless of popularity and recency, the returned content is unlikely to be what the user intended to find with the query or there is no clear relationship between the query and the content

.
Examples:

.
3.2 Navigational (Single Results Navigational & Video Navigational)
Navigational queries are generally looking for a specific piece of content (i.e. a specific movie or show) or a finite set of content such as a film-trilogy. In these cases we allow for a “Perfect” rating for those specifically intended pieces of content.

General Guideline:
Perfect → If navigational content and result is certainly primary intent of user, rate it “Perfect”, regardless of popularity and recency. For Franchise related queries, please follow the Franchise specific guidelines as outlined above.
Excellent → If the returned content is a sequel or prequel of the intended content, or the content is part of a movie bundle with the intended content, rate the result as “Excellent”.
Good → If the returned content is relevant to the query, and either recent or popular, or can be considered a secondary intent, rate it as “Good”. 
Acceptable → If the returned content is relevant to the query, but neither recent nor popular or can only poorly satisfy a secondary intent, it can be rated as “Acceptable”.
Off-Topic → If the content is not relevant to the query or it is very unlikely that a user would search for the returned content with the given query, it can be rated off-topic.


.
Examples:

.
3.3 Similarity
Instead of looking at popularity and recency, you should focus on how similar the content is to the referenced content. The main goal of similarity searches and ratings is to capture “if a user liked piece of content x, will they also like piece of content y?”

Evaluate Similarity based on Target Audience, Factual Aspects, and Theme.

For similarity queries, there may be additional aspects highlighted such as “movies like x”, “comedies similar to y”. In those cases the ratings should take the highlighted aspect as necessary to reach the minimum “Acceptable” rating.

General Guideline:
Excellent → Similarity in 3 aspects (Target Audience, Factual Aspect and Theme)
Good → Similarity in 2 aspects or just a close match in Target Audience
Acceptable → Similarity in only Factual Aspects or Theme, or if it's a mentioned content (see section 3.4.3)
Off-Topic → No Similarity

.
Examples:

.

3.4 Special Cases
There are a variety of special cases to be aware of, where the rating scales are slightly different from what is written above. 

Please note that the below guidelines are meant to augment the guidelines above, not override them. For instance, the additional guidance for a query referencing a person has maximum rating of “Excellent”, however, for a navigational query such as “movie where tom hanks is stuck on a island” the intended movie of “Cast Away” would still get a “Perfect” rating.

Here are a list of special cases covered in this document:

.

3.4.1 Result Filters
When handling queries that include tokens like [‘new’, ‘best’, ‘movies’, ‘shows’], consider these filters along with the core intent:
[new] → emphasize on recency aspect, the popularity aspect is less important
[best] → emphasize on the popularity and awards aspect, the recency aspect is less important
[movies] → consider only content in that content type (here: movie) as relevant. Shows in this case can be rated as off-topic

3.4.2 'Free' Queries
For queries with strings such as “free”, “free for me”, please consider what streaming services in your market are free along with content that is available explicitly for free. This includes TV shows where the first episode is available for free. Use the below guidance to rate these queries.
Short queries that include the string “free” (“free movies”, “free shows”, “free”)
Excellent → all AppleTV+ originals
Good → non AppleTV+ content that is popular and recent
Acceptable → non AppleTV+ content that is popular or recent
Off-Topic → non Apple TV+ content that is neither popular, nor recent
Longer queries that include the string “free” (“free comedy movies”, “free horror shows”, “scary movies free for me”)
Check if the content is free and then rate based on other aspects of content
“free denzel 2000s”
check if content is free, from the 2000s and features Denzel Washington
if yes and Denzel Washington stars in the content then rating is excellent
If Denzel is in a lesser role, rate based on recency and popularity
“free comedy movies” 
check if content is free, a comedy and a movie
if yes then rate based on recency and popularity

Note: In addition to using traditional web resources, one can also check if a content is free follow these steps:
Click the link that is the title of the returned content


.
This will bring you to apple tv product page of the content in the country of the evaluation

.


Here you will see what platforms the content is available through
For instance in the US free streaming platforms include (but are not limited too): Tubi TV, Pluto TV, Amazon FreeVee, Plex
Other services may have some free content available
3.4.3 Mentioned Content
Users may search for content by referencing another piece of content. In these cases

Typical Structure for Mentioned Content Queries:
Similarity: “shows like game of thrones”
Recursion: “movies with the actor of ron weasly”

General Guideline:
Excellent:
Other highly relevant / related content
Acceptable:
The mentioned content(s)
Special Cases:
Franchise
Content under the same branding as the mentioned content is “Acceptable”
Franchise content under different branding is rated according to the franchise / similarity rules


.
3.4.4 Misspelling/Alternate Spelling
Some words can be spelled in multiple ways or frequently misspelled. Since search is able to handle misspellings, please evaluate the intent rather than the exact text.
[rhe] / [thr] / [yhe] → Common misspellings for the word “the”
[nruto] → Likely looking for “Naruto”
[bestmovies] → Probably intended as “best movies”
[4], [IV], [Four] → consider synonyms
[pray] vs [prey] → since Siri relies on voice input, there can be "misspellings" that come from homonyms that sound similar
3.4.5 Harmful Queries
Queries or content related but not limited to the following topics that may be offensive or sensitive:
Bias
Discrimination
Hatred
Restricted or Regulated Content
Self-Harm
Sexual Material
Toxicity
Vulgarity/Obscenities
Violence
If the result returned contains an offensive or sensitive response to the query, please mark it as “Unacceptable: Off-Topic”.

Note: If the query refers to a content title (movie, TV show), it should not be considered offensive or sensitive. E.g., ‘How to Get Away with Murder’ is a title for a popular legal thriller TV show and should not be considered as a safety concern.

3.4.6 Kids Content
Kids' content should be demoted by one rating level, unless:
The query is explicitly about kids' content
The query is indirectly related to kids' content (e.g., query contains “kids,” “animation,” “for the family,” etc.).
The content is relevant and rated Acceptable - do not demote Acceptable to Off-Topic since relevant content should always be rated as at least Acceptable.
Use the “Kids&Family” genre, Common Sense Media, and your own knowledge to determine if content is specifically targeting kids.

Examples:
[adventure shows to binge this weekend] → “Yakari”: The returned show is in the intended genre and very popular, however dated and hence could be rated as “Good”. However, since it is primarily kids content, it will be rated “Acceptable”.

3.4.7 Explicit Content
Rate all pornographic content as “Unacceptable: Off-Topic“ unless the query intent is specifically for erotic content, or porn.
[drama movies for me and my friends] → any pornographic content is “Unacceptable: Off-Topic”
[erotica] / [porn] → erotic content can receive any rating
[18+] / [movies for adults] → intent here is not specifically for pornographic or erotic content


3.4.8 Classic Content
Ignore recency for classic movies and TV shows that were among the most popular in their release decade or remain highly popular today.

3.4.9 Pre-Release Content
Sometimes the result is the preview page for content which is not yet available for viewing. The timing of the release can be ignored. Different sources will need to be utilized to determine popularity than for already released content.
Complete research to determine expected popularity (ex. YouTube trailers, production budget, famous cast and crew)
Original content from Apple TV+, Netflix, Hulu, or other popular production company - generally assumed to be popular. 

3.4.10 Franchise
Core franchise are central, primary films (e.g. Harry Potter main films) and non-core includes supplementary or spin-off films (e.g. Fantastic Beasts).

First and last item of core franchise → Perfect
Please make an honest determination of the order in which users would typically watch the collection or franchise of content and use this to complete the rating. Use comment to justify decision. 
Other content in core franchise → Excellent
Content in the franchise, but not core
popular and recent → Excellent
popular or recent → Good
neither popular nor recent → Acceptable

3.4.11 Movie Bundles
Movie bundles are a collection of films grouped together, with titles like “James Bond 10 Film Collection.”
Determine the rating for the content related to the query. Once the rating for the content is determined, demote rating by one level.

Example:
[No time to Die] → James Bond 10 Film collection is Excellent since No time to Die in the collection is the primary intent


3.4.12 Music Results
If the Music result satisfies a potential user intent → Acceptable
If the Music result does not satisfy a potential user intent → Unacceptable: Off-Topic

3.4.13 AppleTV+ Content
Users are using Search on Apple TV which indicates a preference for Apple TV+ content such as Ted Lasso, Coda, Severance or Tehran. Therefore:
Popularity is slightly less strict for Apple TV+ content
If you are in doubt about “Good” or “Excellent” for an Apple TV+ result, select “Excellent”

3.4.14 Sporting / Live Event

.
Please determine if the query is directly relevant to the sporting event (clear Primary Intent) or if the intent of the query can reasonably be multiple things, including non-sports events (Partial Intent or Secondary Intent).

The following guidance can help determine the proper rating, however, please rely primarily on your own market knowledge and query relevance to make your judgement.

Clear Primary Intent 
Perfect → live event when query is for a team or single day event
Excellent → popular live events when query is for a sport, league or multi-day event. Also video on demand assets for recent championship events. Also for teams in intended league
Good → less popular live events related to the query that satisfy a secondary intent. Also movies and tv shows related to the query that is popular and recent
Acceptable → unpopular live events and video on demand content for relevant non-championship live events. Also movies and tv shows related to the query that are not popular and recent

Partial Intent or Secondary Intent
Note that all ambiguous queries that have live events as a potential secondary intent, shall be rated based on the Live Event guidelines. The “Perfect” rating category is not available in this case.
[foot] → “football”

.
Note that the examples below may have already taken place in the past. Please assume that live assets are either ongoing or upcoming.

.

3.4.15 Apple Event / WWDC 
Primary Intent (e.g., “Apple Event replays,” “WWDC with a new iPhone announced,” “Apple Developer Conference film”):
Perfect: Events within a year from the current date of rating
Example: Apple Event 05.07.24, WWDC 2024
Excellent: Events older than a year but less than 2 years from the current date of rating
Example: Apple Event 10.30.23, WWDC 2023
Good: Events older than 2 years but less than 3 years from the current date of rating
Example: WWDC 2022
Acceptable: Events older than 3 years
Example: Apple Event 09.10.19, WWDC 2019
Secondary Intent (e.g., “Apple,” “iPhone,” “new technology,” “web conference,” “WW”):
Demote the ratings by one level from the primary intent criteria.
Irrelevant Content (e.g. “2022,” “W,” “September 2021”)
If the Apple Event / WWDC content is relevant to the query but is unlikely to match the intent, rate as “Acceptable”

*date of publishing these examples: 8/1/24


3.4.16 Time Period Queries
Some queries specify a time period, like [action movies from the 80’s]. In these cases, recency is not important; instead, the focus should be on whether the content fits the specified time frame. For such queries, focus on popularity for the final rating.

note: TV shows can remain relevant across multiple years or time periods based on when their seasons aired. For example, Friends is relevant for both queries [i want to watch a classic 90’s sitcom] and [2000’s most popular shows]


General Guideline:
Excellent:
Content which won major award(s) in the given year/decade 
Ultra Popular (Approximately): 
Top 50 most viewed shows/films associated with decade
Top 10 most viewed films associated with year
Ultra popular show has >=50% of seasons/episodes in decade 
Good:
Popular shows/movie associated with year/decade
Show has 3+ seasons (or >50%) in decade 
Popular (Approximately):
Top 100 most viewed in decade
Top 30 most viewed films from year
Acceptable:
Content released in year/decade
Show has 1+ season in decade 
Off-Topic:
Content not from year/decade

.

.
3.4.17 Seasonal Results
In some locales, certain results gain additional relevance and popularity at specific times of the year. For example, holiday movies are very popular in the US during the end of the year. Please consider the seasonal popularity when rating results and adjust the rating accordingly.

Examples (US results during December):
[s] → “Spirited”: Always “Excellent”, new and very popular result, “Excellent” is the best result for an “Ambiguous - Intent Unclear” query
[c] → “A Charlie Brown Christmas”: If rating the result in July this would be a “Good” result as it is relevant and popular, but not quite at the level of a classic that would receive an “Excellent” rating. However, if this result surfaces in the November / December timeframe it should be rated as “Excellent” as it is a holiday classic and an “Excellent” result at that time
[bo] → “A Boyfriend for Christmas”: If rating in the summer this would be an “Acceptable” result, it is relevant but not recent or popular. During the Holiday season it would be rated as “Good”, being a Christmas Romantic Comedy, it has additional popularity during that period

3.4.18 Character
Intent for “Character” queries can be both Movies and TV Shows. Often, the Franchise section (3.4.10) will apply to ratings for characters. In cases where the main character name and the title of the content match, character shall be the dominating classification.

General Guideline:
Perfect: 
The most popular and recent content featuring this character in a major role. (Apply “Franchise Query” Rule). 
If only one content with the character is produced, this content can be rated “Perfect”
Excellent: 
Sequels/prequels for the show in which the character is best known
Other high-quality content featuring the character
Person page for well known actor/actress who plays the character
Good: 
Content which is in the same franchise but about a different character 
If the character has their own spinoff, the ‘parent’ show where the character first appeared 
Acceptable: 
Show/movie features the character in insignificant role


.

.

3.4.19 Person
Some queries may reference a person, be it an actor, director, producer, musician, etc. Use the guidelines below to modify your rating for queries with such a reference. This guidance is primarily for Browse queries featuring a person.

General Guideline:
Excellent: 
Content with the intended person as lead in cast & crew 
Most popular documentary about the person (more than 1 possible if equal in popularity/quality)
Recent and popular live event with person 
Content where person is a significant guest star. Hosted by reputable content creator. 
Set of most popular content inspired by the person 
Person page 
Good: 
Documentary about the person that is popular, but not most popular or recent
Popular live event with person 
Popular content inspired by the person 
Content with the intended person as cast & crew that is popular or recent
Acceptable
Unpopular content about/with the person
Content with the intended person as cast & crew (not as lead)

.


.

3.4.20 Awards
Users searching for an award show are generally interested in (1) watching nominated movies/shows before the award event, or (2) watching movies/shows which won the most recent award event. Recent winners should receive higher ratings, unless the query specifies a specific edition of the award event. 

Definitions:
If award event upcoming: Nominations have already been announced for the next upcoming award event.
If no award event upcoming: Nominations for next upcoming award event are not announced yet.

General Guideline:
Perfect:
Most recent award event show
Currently ongoing or upcoming live award event show
Excellent:
If award event upcoming: nominees (movies, tv shows or actors) for the upcoming award event. The returned content itself needs to be nominated 
If movie returned, movie needs to be nominated
If person page is returned, person needs to be nominated
If no award event upcoming: winners of the most recent award event
Good:
If award event upcoming: winners of the most recent award event
If no award event upcoming: winners of previous award events, nominees of most recent award event
Similar award event shows
Acceptable:
Movies/Shows featuring people associated with award show 
Nominees of previous award events
Exceptions:
If a year is specified in the query, consider only results relevant to the year
Perfect → content that won an award that year
Excellent → content that was nominated for that year
Off-Topic → content has no association with the award in the given year

.


.
3.4.21 Brand Results
At time you will see Brand Results such as the channel page for a streaming service. These results should be rated based on relevance to the query.
[dramas on prime video] → The Prime Video brand page would be very relevant and considered an “Excellent” result
[soccer] → MLS Season Pass page and MLS team pages would be very relevant and “Excellent” results
[sports] → 
ESPN and MLS Season Pass pages are very relevant and “Excellent” results
Prime Video and Peacock both sometimes feature live sports but it is not as much of a focus for them and would be “Good” results


3.5 Problem: Other
Please rate "Problem: Other" in the following scenarios:
1. When there is problem or technical issue with the task in BaseLine that makes it impossible to judge relevance. This can also be used when the result is not a TV show / movie (e.g. podcast, movie, etc.).
2. When you come across queries such as [cancel subscription], [settings], or [log out] which are not relevant to any video content.
3. When you come across a preview page which has incorrect or missing data such as wrong Cast and Crew, wrong Release Date, or the wrong artwork. 

Please describe the issue in the comment section.
